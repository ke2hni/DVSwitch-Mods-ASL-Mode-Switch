## 📡 What this repository does

DVSwitch-Mods provides two types of changes:

- **Repairs** correct confirmed problems in DVSwitch, including malformed P25
  and YSF commands, database downloads, P25 announcements, and dashboard link
  detection.
- **Modifications** add optional dashboard features such as friendly reflector
  and talkgroup names, D-Star reflector details, FCC first names, and cleaner
  activity targets. The separate STFU activity component reads STFU's own log
  and adds its RX/TX events to the Gateway Activity, Local Activity, and TRX
  views. STFU is displayed on its own status card rather than the DMR Master
  card. Its target comes from the saved STFU mode target, then `[STFU] StartTG`
  in `/opt/MMDVM_Bridge/DVSwitch.ini`, with the STFU log as a standalone fallback.
  It does not use the shared Analog_Bridge `last_tune` value, which can change
  with BM/TGIF tuning. STFU rows display `0%` Loss and `0.0%` BER as cosmetic placeholders,
  not measured values, because STFU does not provide those measurements.

Standard component installers check compatibility before changing anything,
create protected backups, install atomically, validate the result, and roll
back automatically if installation fails. The standalone Dark Mode and
Widescreen Display Layout installers maintain protected and per-run backups
and provide explicit restore commands.

---

## 🚀 Quick start — install everything

### 1. Download the complete repository

Run this from your home directory:

```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/ke2hni/DVSwitch-Mods.git && cd DVSwitch-Mods
```

Already downloaded it? Update it instead:

```bash
cd ~/DVSwitch-Mods && git pull --ff-only
```

You can also download one ZIP containing the entire repository from the
green **Code** button on GitHub or use the
**[direct ZIP download](https://github.com/ke2hni/DVSwitch-Mods/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**.
Do not download the scripts individually.

### 2. Use the installer menu

Run the manager without arguments:

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh
```

The menu provides three installation choices and an uninstall choice:

1. **Standard DVSwitch repairs and modifications** — runs the complete
   dependency-ordered installation and records its reversible backups.
2. **Dark Mode** — launches the standalone dashboard theme installer. It adds
   the Auto/Light/Dark selector and creates its own protected and per-run
   backups.
3. **Widescreen Display Layout** — launches the standalone responsive-layout
   installer. It creates its own protected and per-run backups.
4. **Uninstall all standard components** — restores every standard component
   recorded by this manager in reverse installation order.

The Dark Mode and Display Layout installers do not require the standard
component chain. STFU status, STFU activity, and RX Monitor position are
included at the end of the standard component installation and uninstall
order. Option 0 exits without changing anything. The standalone Dark Mode and
Widescreen installers are managed separately and are not removed by option 4.

The standalone installers can also be run directly:

```bash
sudo ./dvswitch-dark-mode.sh apply
sudo ./dvswitch-display-layout.sh apply
```

### 3. Check the complete standard installation

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --check all
```

STFU activity can also be checked or installed by itself:

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --check dashboard-stfu-activity
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --install dashboard-stfu-activity
```

The component can also be checked or installed directly, without the manager:

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-stfu-activity.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dashboard-stfu-activity.sh --install
```

On a fresh DVSwitch installation, the first check normally reports early
components as ready and later components as blocked by prerequisites. It checks
everything, changes nothing, and prints the correct installation order.
The P25 audio-announcement check builds a temporary candidate and therefore
needs `make` and a C++ compiler. If either is missing, `--check all` reports the
P25 component as blocked and continues checking the remaining components; it
does not install packages. If an install requires `make` or `c++` and either is
missing, the manager stops before changing components and prints the explicit
Debian command to install `build-essential`. Run that command yourself, then
retry the install.

### 4. Install or update every applicable standard repair and modification

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --install all
```

The manager installs components in the required order, selects the correct
MMDVM repair for the installed architecture, skips components that do not
apply, records every backup, and resumes safely if an installation is
interrupted. It is upgrade-aware: manager records do not cause components to
be skipped. Each component's current `--check` and `--install` logic decides
whether it is current, needs a newer compatible repository update, or must be
refused as unsupported or customized.

When a newer compatible version is available, the manager creates a new
protected backup and replaces that component's active manager record. When the
installed version is current, the component remains idempotent and no new
backup is created.

### 5. Verify the completed standard installation

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --check all
```

A completed installation should end with no failed or blocked components.

---

## 🔧 Repairs

Repairs may be installed individually. Always run `--check` first.

### MMDVM P25 and YSF spacing repair

**What it fixes:** Corrects malformed remote commands so MMDVM_Bridge sends
`TalkGroup 10200` to P25Gateway and `LinkYSF 44444` to YSFGateway.

**Prerequisite:** None. The manager detects the installed architecture and
selects exactly one repair.

```bash
sudo ./manage-mmdvm-spacing.sh --check
sudo ./manage-mmdvm-spacing.sh --install
```

Supported completed repairs:

- ARM64: `repair-mmdvm-spacing.sh`
- AMD64 or i386: `repair-mmdvm-spacing-x86.sh`

The separate ARMHF testing release is documented near the bottom of this page.

### DVSwitch database updater repair

**What it fixes:** Validates TXT database downloads before atomically replacing
working files, preventing empty or damaged downloads from being installed.

**Prerequisite:** None. This repair must be installed before
`mod-p25-nxdn-json.sh`.

```bash
sudo ./repair-dvswitch-txt-updater.sh --check
sudo ./repair-dvswitch-txt-updater.sh --install
```

### ASL mode-switch routing repair

**What it fixes:** Routes Analog_Bridge remote-control commands to a live TLV
UDP listener and selects the active listener when leaving ASL mode. This
addresses the stale-port behavior observed with `dvswitch.sh` 1.6.2 and 1.6.3.
It patches `/opt/MMDVM_Bridge/dvswitch.sh`, saves a protected backup under
`/var/backups/dvswitch-mods/asl-mode-switch`, and does not restart services.

This repair is a standalone script. It is not registered in the
DVSwitch-Mods manager and does not run through its Install All option. Run it
directly on a test node after updating the repository:

```bash
sudo ./repair-dvswitch-asl-mode-switch.sh --check
sudo ./repair-dvswitch-asl-mode-switch.sh --install
sudo ./repair-dvswitch-asl-mode-switch.sh --restore install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

The script creates a protected, timestamped backup, is safe to rerun, and
refuses unknown or partially modified structures. It supports `dvswitch.sh`
versions 1.6.2 and 1.6.3. Rebooting or restarting a service is not required
for the shell-script change to take effect.

### P25 audio-announcement repair

**What it fixes:** Makes P25 remote voice announcements begin immediately and
adds an 800 ms silent lead-in so the start of the announcement is not clipped.

**Prerequisite:** ARM64 or AMD64, Internet access during the pinned source
build, and P25Gateway version `20201105`.

```bash
sudo ./repair-p25-audio-announcement.sh --check
sudo ./repair-p25-audio-announcement.sh --install
```

### P25 dashboard repair

**What it fixes:** Allows the dashboard to recognize P25Gateway remote-command
and static-startup reflector messages.

**Prerequisite:** None. Install it before the P25/NXDN friendly-name
modification.

```bash
sudo ./repair-p25-dashboard.sh --check
sudo ./repair-p25-dashboard.sh --install
```

### YSF dashboard null repair

**What it fixes:** Uses case-insensitive YSF room matching and prevents the
dashboard from displaying a literal `null` instead of the linked room name.

**Prerequisite:** `mod-dmr-friendly-names.sh` and a valid `YSFHosts.txt`.

```bash
sudo ./repair-ysf-dashboard-null.sh --check
sudo ./repair-ysf-dashboard-null.sh --install
```

---

## ✨ Optional modifications

These features are included by `--install all`, or they can be installed
individually in the order shown below.

### 1. P25 and NXDN JSON databases

**What it adds:** Validated P25 and NXDN JSON downloads for dashboard-friendly
reflector information.

**Required first:** `repair-dvswitch-txt-updater.sh`.

```bash
sudo ./mod-p25-nxdn-json.sh --check
sudo ./mod-p25-nxdn-json.sh --install
```

### 2. P25 and NXDN friendly names

**What it adds:** P25 and NXDN reflector names with sponsor and numeric
fallbacks on the dashboard.

**Required first:** `repair-p25-dashboard.sh`, `mod-p25-nxdn-json.sh`, and valid
P25/NXDN JSON files.

The structural check recognizes the recoverable state where the friendly-name
helper is already in `functions.php` but a whole-file rollback removed the two
`status.php` wrappers. It restores only those wrappers and leaves the helper and
other dashboard changes untouched. Other incomplete or ambiguous states are
reported as errors and are not modified.

```bash
sudo ./mod-p25-nxdn-friendly-names.sh --check
sudo ./mod-p25-nxdn-friendly-names.sh --install
```

### 3. D-Star Tx TG/Ref display

**What it adds:** D-Star transmit talkgroup/reference information and the
reflector module on the dashboard.

**Required first:** `mod-p25-nxdn-friendly-names.sh`.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dstar-tx-ref.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dstar-tx-ref.sh --install
```

### 4. DMR friendly names

**What it adds:** DMR BM/TGIF Master headings and BrandMeister/TGIF talkgroup
names with long-name wrapping. This is display-only; it does not add buttons,
mode switching, network switching, presets, privileged helpers, or saved network
state. Blank BrandMeister names
and valid reflector entries are accepted because they are normal records in
the published list; unnamed entries simply have no friendly name to display.

**Required first:** `mod-dstar-tx-ref.sh` and valid BrandMeister and TGIF lists.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dmr-friendly-names.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dmr-friendly-names.sh --install
```

After this modification, install the YSF dashboard null repair described in
the Repairs section.

### 5. Worldwide DMR/FCC names

**What it adds:** A Name column to Gateway Activity, a clickable `---` entry
prompt, and a legend popup that shows where manual names are stored. DVSwitch's
worldwide `DMRIds.dat` supplies the complete meaningful name or description,
including international operators and entries such as club names. Blank,
placeholder, conflicting, or malformed DMR names fall back to the FCC first-name
database; active FCC club or organization licenses without a personal first name
use the FCC entity name as their fallback. `---` is shown only when neither source
supplies usable data. The mod also
installs a self-contained weekly FCC database updater and randomized systemd
timer.

If no usable FCC/DMR name is available, the dashboard checks the custom
description file and then the operator-name file. Custom descriptions are
stored at `/etc/dvswitch-mods/callsign-descriptions.tsv`; operator names are
stored at `/etc/dvswitch-mods/callsign-lookup.tsv` and marked with `*`. Lookup
order is FCC/DMR data, custom descriptions, manual operator names, then the
CTY.DAT country fallback. FCC/DMR data and custom descriptions therefore
supersede a manual operator name. The `---` marker is clickable; choose `1` to
save an operator name or `2` to save a custom description. The prompt names the
destination file, and entries are saved locally without querying QRZ, QRZCQ, or
another service. The legend also says that `---` can be clicked. During
installation, the installer downloads and
validates CTY.DAT when no valid copy is present, so the first install is ready
without a separate updater command. The weekly updater refreshes CTY.DAT and
keeps the previous file if a later refresh fails. The country line is omitted
only when no country matches.

Lookup input is normalized only for the private database lookup: surrounding or
internal spaces and trailing Unicode replacement characters are removed, and
standard `/suffix` or `-suffix` forms are reduced to the base callsign. The
original transmitted callsign remains unchanged on the dashboard. This handles
values such as `WD1V ��` without converting international suffixes into FCC data.

**Required first:** Independent of the P25/NXDN/DMR chain, but install it before
the dashboard Target display modification. Internet access is required for the
initial FCC database build and CTY.DAT download.
On a stock DVSwitch install, Local Activity has no legend yet. The FCC installer
creates the legend at the stock Local Activity ending. The later Target
modification preserves it without adding a duplicate.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-fcc-first-names.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dashboard-fcc-first-names.sh --install
```

The installer adds missing starter custom-description entries from
`data/callsign-descriptions.tsv` to
`/etc/dvswitch-mods/callsign-descriptions.tsv`. Edit the installed file to add
exact identifiers in `CALLSIGN = DESCRIPTION` format, with spaces around `=`.
One identifier goes on each line. Existing tab-separated entries remain
supported. The installer preserves existing rows and values, including when a
starter row uses the same identifier, and appends only identifiers not already
present. `--check` reports how many starter descriptions are missing without
changing the file; re-running installation does not add duplicates. Lookup
order is FCC/DMR name, custom description, manual operator name, then CTY.DAT
country fallback. Upgrades preserve the installed file and its edits; the file
is also retained on uninstall. Custom identifiers may contain internal
hyphens; for example, use `AL-LINK = Alabama Link` when the dashboard displays
`AL-LINK`. The custom-description prompt keeps that exact identifier.

Starter entries currently include `9998`, `9999`, `MMDVM`, and `N0CALL`
(announcements), `H4MLNK` (YSF Link), `EC0LINK` (EchoLink), `XLX618`,
`SRVPROBA`, `SRVPROBB`, and `AMERICALNK`.

Manual operator names are stored in `/etc/dvswitch-mods/callsign-lookup.tsv` as
`CALLSIGN = NAME`, one entry per line. The installer adds any missing entries
from `data/callsign-lookup.tsv` without replacing the existing file or its
contents. Existing callsign entries always keep their current value when a
starter row has the same callsign. Re-running the installer adds no duplicates;
`--check` reports how many starter entries are still missing without changing
the file and whether existing rows are in alphabetical order. Installation
sorts callsign rows alphabetically while keeping each name with its callsign;
new manual entries are saved in the same order. Header comments and unrecognized
lines are retained at the top of the file. Hover over or keyboard-focus **file location** in the dashboard
legend to display the full path. Both user files are retained during upgrades
and uninstall so their entries can be reviewed or reused.

Manual FCC update:

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-fcc-first-names.sh --update
```

### 6. Cleaner dashboard targets

**What it adds:** Row-specific friendly talkgroup and reflector names, D-Star
routes, and a compact legend with separation from the Local Activity grid.
Talkgroup modes display friendly names followed by `(TG ###)`. Reflector or
room modes display the friendly name followed by `(TG ###)`. YSF room
references are resolved from the YSFGateway link history using each activity
row's timestamp and then matched against `YSFHosts.txt`, so historical rows
retain the room that was active when the reception occurred. YSF Group Call
and GPS/Data activity therefore display the resolved room name instead of a
generic activity label. D-Star `CQCQCQ via REF030 C` rows display as `REF030 C`
without a redundant `(Ref 030)` suffix; a bare `CQCQCQ` remains `General Call`.
If no friendly DMR talkgroup name is available, the target displays as `TG ###`
without repeating the same number in parentheses. For D-Star rows with a bare
`CQCQCQ` target, the reflector is resolved from ircDDBGateway link history at
the activity event time, so older rows keep the reflector linked when they
were received. Rows with no linked reflector remain `General Call`.
The target checker also recognizes the separate STFU activity component's
BrandMeister-name wrapper, so rerunning or upgrading `dashboard-targets` keeps
both components working together.

**Required first:** `mod-dashboard-fcc-first-names.sh`; valid P25/NXDN JSON and
BrandMeister/TGIF lists provide the friendly names.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-targets.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dashboard-targets.sh --install
```

### 7. Activity mode labels

**What it adds:** Gateway Activity labels MMDVM_Bridge DMR rows as **BM** or
**TGIF**, based on the bridge network active when each event was logged.
Selecting STFU does not change that label: STFU is separate from the BM/TGIF
DMR network setting. STFU activity continues to come from the STFU log and is
shown as STFU. Earlier rows keep their labels after a network change. Local
Activity and non-DMR protocols are unchanged. The component watches the
MMDVM_Bridge network configuration. When DVSwitch-Mode-Buttons is installed,
its mode-state file also triggers a bridge-network check; the selected mode is
never used as the DMR network label. BM/TGIF tracking works without Mode Buttons.

This is a standalone modification and is also included in the standard
`manage-dvswitch-mods.sh` installation. Its entry point remains
`mod-dashboard-activity-modes.sh`.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-activity-modes.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dashboard-activity-modes.sh --install
```

### 8. Hostname-prefixed dashboard title

**What it adds:** The detected system hostname before the existing dashboard
heading and browser-tab title. For example, a host named `pi4test` displays
`pi4test DVSwitch Dashboard` in both places. The hostname is generated by PHP
when the page is rendered, so the same installed modification displays the
current name on each node without being rerun after a hostname change.

This is a surgical modification to the exact `<title>DVSwitch Dashboard</title>`
and `<h2>DVSwitch Dashboard</h2>` blocks in `index.php`. It does not modify
dashboard layout, CSS, themes, activity tables, or Local Activity logic.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-hostname-title.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dashboard-hostname-title.sh --install
```

### 9. Dashboard Dark Mode

**What it adds:** A dashboard theme selector with **Auto**, **Light**, and
**Dark** modes. Auto follows the browser or operating-system color preference.
The theme is applied to the dashboard without changing DVSwitch's live status
colors.
When DVSwitch-Mode-Buttons supplies the standalone DMR card, the dark theme
also recolors its `Room` label for contrast. The stylesheet supports both the
updated semantic label and the prior installed markup during upgrades.

**Required first:** None. This is a standalone dashboard overlay and is also
available as option 2 in the manager menu. It may be run after the standard
installation and before the display-layout installer.

```bash
sudo ./dvswitch-dark-mode.sh apply
```

### 9. STFU status cards

**What it adds:** STFU and STFU Net cells to the dashboard's existing green
Modes and Networks status strip. Both cells show green while the STFU process
is running and red while it is stopped. The update modifies only
`/usr/share/dvswitch/include/system.php`, validates PHP syntax, creates a
protected backup, and writes atomically. The manager installs it at the end of
the standard component sequence and records its backup for ordered
uninstallation.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-stfu-status.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dashboard-stfu-status.sh --install
```

Restore a named backup created by the standalone installer:

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-stfu-status.sh --uninstall install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

### 10. RX Monitor position

**What it changes:** Moves the existing RX Monitor button from the centered
area below the mode buttons to the left status column above the Status panel.
It preserves the existing `RXMONITOR` configuration check and audio-toggle
behavior, leaving the former centered position available for another dashboard
modification. Only `index.php` is changed. The installer checks PHP syntax,
creates a protected backup, and writes atomically. The manager installs it at
the end of the standard component sequence and tracks named backups for
reverse-order uninstallation when installed through the manager.

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-rx-monitor-left.sh --check
sudo ./mod-dashboard-rx-monitor-left.sh --install
```

Restore a named backup created by the standalone installer:

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-rx-monitor-left.sh --uninstall install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

The generated web assets are installed as readable Apache files with
`root:root` ownership and mode `0644`, including on a completely fresh
installation.

Restore the latest Dark Mode run backup:

```bash
sudo ./dvswitch-dark-mode.sh restore-latest
```

Restore the protected pre-theme dashboard files:

```bash
sudo ./dvswitch-dark-mode.sh restore-original
```

### 9. Widescreen Display Layout

**What it adds:** Responsive dashboard width, readable table wrapping, wider
Gateway and Local Activity panels, and centered Hardware Info on compatible
screens.

**Required first:** None. This is a standalone dashboard layout installer and
is also available as option 3 in the manager menu. Run it after Dark Mode when
both are being installed together.

```bash
sudo ./dvswitch-display-layout.sh apply
```

Restore the latest layout run backup:

```bash
sudo ./dvswitch-display-layout.sh restore-latest
```

Restore the protected pre-layout dashboard files:

```bash
sudo ./dvswitch-display-layout.sh restore-original
```

---

## 🧭 Complete installation order

The unified manager handles this order automatically:

1. MMDVM spacing repair for the detected architecture
2. DVSwitch database updater repair
3. P25 audio announcement repair for ARM64 or AMD64
4. P25 dashboard repair
5. Dashboard duration type repair
6. P25/NXDN JSON databases
7. P25/NXDN friendly names
8. D-Star Tx TG/Ref display
9. DMR friendly names
10. YSF dashboard null repair
11. Worldwide DMR/FCC names
12. Dashboard target display
13. Dashboard cell spacing and Target wrapping
14. Hostname-prefixed dashboard title

The optional standalone dashboard installers are run separately from the
manager's recorded standard-component order:

15. Dark Mode overlay
16. Widescreen Display Layout

The removed Select Mode buttons and mode/network-switching project is not part
of this repository. Its separate reference archive must be retained outside
the repository for future development.

The menu provides separate options to launch these two standalone installers;
their backups are maintained by the standalone scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> Re-running `--install all` after downloading a newer repository version is
> supported. The manager rechecks every applicable component instead of
> relying only on its previous installation record. Component installers still
> refuse missing, ambiguous, customized, or unsupported targets.

> [!NOTE]
> The DVSwitch database updater cannot be run more than once per hour. The
> manager enforces this limit and reports how long remains before another
> attempt is permitted.

---

## ↩️ Status, backups, and removal

Option 4 in the interactive menu, or the command line, uninstalls all standard
components installed and recorded by the manager. Review the active records
before removing anything:

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --status
```

To start the same reverse-order uninstall from the menu, run
`sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh` and choose option 4.

On a test node, remove all manager-recorded standard components with:

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --uninstall all
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --status
```

The manager restores each component from its protected backup in strict reverse
installation order. A successful run ends with
`PASS: all manager-recorded installations were uninstalled in reverse order.`
The follow-up `--status` should report that there are no active manager-recorded
installations. If a restore fails or its backup is unavailable, the manager
stops and retains that component's active record so the problem can be reviewed.
Dashboard cell-padding preserves each file's existing line-ending style. The
Target restore guard also accepts a verified file when only its LF/CRLF style
differs; it still stops on any content difference.
If an FCC upgrade backup does not contain `lh.php`, its uninstaller checks older
FCC backups and uses one only when its pre-FCC snapshot reproduces the current
file exactly after applying the FCC patch. If no matching baseline is available,
it stops without changing FCC files or removing that active record.

This removes only standard components recorded by the manager. It does not
uninstall DVSwitch itself, the separate DVSwitch Mode Buttons repository, or
the standalone Dark Mode and Widescreen Display Layout changes. Those two
standalone installers have their own restore commands below.

The status file records the currently active reversible backup for each
component. An upgrade replaces that component's active record with the new
backup; older backup directories are retained for manual recovery.

To remove one component, first run `--status` and use the last (newest) active
record shown there. For example, replace `COMPONENT` with that component's exact
name:

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --uninstall COMPONENT
```

Because several components can edit the same dashboard files, an individual
component can be removed only when it is the newest active record. If another
component must be removed first, the manager reports which one; use
`--uninstall all` to let it safely unwind the complete recorded stack.

Protected backups are stored under:

```text
/var/backups/dvswitch-mods/
```

Individual scripts can restore their named `install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` backup. Dashboard
restore actions that use whole-file snapshots first verify that the current file
contains only the mod's known edits; they stop if another mod changed the file:

```bash
sudo ./SCRIPT_NAME.sh --restore install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

<details>
<summary><strong>DVSwitch was uninstalled and reinstalled</strong></summary>

Before changing anything, the manager confirms that every active record still
has its protected backup. If old manager records remain after DVSwitch and its
backups were removed, installation stops safely.

After intentionally reinstalling DVSwitch, archive and clear only the stale
active records with:

```bash
sudo ./manage-dvswitch-mods.sh --reset-after-reinstall
```

The command does not change DVSwitch or delete backups. It refuses to reset
records while every recorded backup remains available.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>FCC updater management</strong></summary>

The weekly updater remains functional even if the repository is removed.

Run it manually:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/sbin/dvswitch-fcc-first-names-update
```

Remove only the automatic updater while preserving the dashboard modification
and database:

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-fcc-first-names.sh --remove-updater
```

Completely remove the modification, database, and updater using the original
installation backup:

```bash
sudo ./mod-dashboard-fcc-first-names.sh --uninstall install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

Inspect the schedule and recent log:

```bash
systemctl list-timers dvswitch-fcc-first-names-update.timer
sudo journalctl -u dvswitch-fcc-first-names-update.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

## 🧪 Supported systems and ARMHF testing

Completed testing includes:

- Raspberry Pi 4 with Debian 12 Bookworm ARM64
- Raspberry Pi 5 with Debian 13 Trixie ARM64
- Dell Wyse 3040 with Debian 13 Trixie AMD64
- Exact i386 MMDVM build on a compatible x86 host

`repair-mmdvm-spacing-armhf.sh` is a testing release for one exact 32-bit ARM
hard-float MMDVM_Bridge build. Its offline candidate and safety tests passed,
but it still requires live P25 and YSF testing on an ARMHF DVSwitch node.

```bash
sudo ./repair-mmdvm-spacing-armhf.sh --check
sudo ./repair-mmdvm-spacing-armhf.sh --install
```

> [!CAUTION]
> For the normal installation, do not run the individual MMDVM spacing repair
> scripts yourself. Run:
>
> ```bash
> sudo ./manage-mmdvm-spacing.sh --check
> sudo ./manage-mmdvm-spacing.sh --install

## 🛡️ Safety rules

- Test on a non-production system first.
- Always run `--check` before `--install`.
- Never bypass an unsupported-version error. The FCC updater checks installed
  scripts structurally and validates the resulting FCC database; it does not
  require release-pinned SHA checksums. MMDVM binary repairs retain their
  build-specific SHA-256 identification because they patch compiled executables.
- Never copy a patched executable or complete upstream file between systems.
- Keep the protected backup until the installation has been fully tested.
- These scripts are not affiliated with or endorsed by the DVSwitch project.

<details>
<summary><strong>If an MMDVM repair rejects the installed binary</strong></summary>

Do not force the existing patch. Start a new ChatGPT session, attach a current
ZIP of this repository and a copy of the rejected, unmodified
`/opt/MMDVM_Bridge/MMDVM_Bridge`, and ask:

> My DVSwitch MMDVM_Bridge spacing repair rejected this exact binary. Analyze
> the attached unmodified binary and repository without changing my live
> system. Determine its architecture, SHA256, size, GNU Build ID, ELF load
> segments, exact P25 and YSF format strings, every code or literal reference
> to those strings, and verified unused mapped or extendable padding. The
> required results are `TalkGroup 10200` and `LinkYSF 44444`; do not treat
> disconnect value 0 as the defect. Create or update a separate hash-specific
> repair only if every offset and reference can be proved. Preserve file size,
> owner, group, mode, atomic installation, protected backup, automatic
> rollback, named restore, `--check`, `--install`, and idempotency. Do not
> modify completed repairs for other architectures. Mark a new build Testing
> until live `strace` and gateway-log results prove both modes. Give me one
> copy-and-paste command at a time, beginning with read-only checks.

Also provide the complete output from:

```bash
cd ~/DVSwitch-Mods && printf '=== REVISION ===\n' && git status --short --branch && git log -1 --oneline --decorate && printf '\n=== SYSTEM ===\n' && uname -a && dpkg --print-architecture && printf '\n=== BINARY ===\n' && sudo sha256sum /opt/MMDVM_Bridge/MMDVM_Bridge && sudo stat -c 'SIZE=%s OWNER=%U:%G MODE=%a' /opt/MMDVM_Bridge/MMDVM_Bridge && sudo file /opt/MMDVM_Bridge/MMDVM_Bridge && sudo readelf -n /opt/MMDVM_Bridge/MMDVM_Bridge | grep -A1 'Build ID' && sudo readelf -lW /opt/MMDVM_Bridge/MMDVM_Bridge && printf '\n=== PACKAGE ===\n' && dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Version} ${Architecture}\n' mmdvm-bridge 2>&1 && apt-cache policy mmdvm-bridge && printf '\n=== REPAIR CHECK ===\n' && sudo ./REPAIR_SCRIPT_NAME.sh --check; printf '\n=== SERVICES ===\n'; systemctl is-active mmdvm_bridge.service ysfgateway.service p25gateway.service
```

Replace `REPAIR_SCRIPT_NAME.sh` with the repair that rejected the binary.
After a test-node installation, capture the exact UDP sends with `strace` and
the new P25Gateway and YSFGateway log entries before marking it completed.
